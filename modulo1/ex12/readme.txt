12 – Using pointer arithmetic, implement a function to 
capitalize the words of a sentence. 
The function should receive the address of a string, 
changing it accordingly. 
The new content should be printed in the main function.
Examples:
• "The number must be saved" → "The Number Must Be Saved"
• "The maximum value of this CYCLE" → "The Maximum Value Of This CYCLE"
