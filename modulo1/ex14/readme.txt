14 – Implement a function void frequencies (float *grades, int n, int *freq) 
 * that receives the address of and array grades with the students’ exam grades at ARQCP 
 * (a float value between 0.0 and 20.0), the number of elements in that array (n), 
 * and the address of a second array (freq) 
 * to be filled with the absolute frequency of the integer part of the grades stored in the array grades. 
 * Use pointer arithmetic to solve this exercise.
 Example:
 the array grades with content 		{8.23,	12.25,	16.45,	12.45,	10.05,	6.45,	14.45,	0.0,	12.67,	16.23,	18.75} 
 should produce a freq array with 	{1, 	0, 		0, 		0, 		0, 		0, 		1, 		0, 		1, 		0, 		1, 		
 * 									 0, 	3, 		0, 		1, 		0, 		2, 		0, 		1, 		0, 		0}
