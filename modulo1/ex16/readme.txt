16 â€“ Using pointer arithmetic, implement a function 
char* where_exists(char* str1, char* str2) 
that receives the address of two strings (str1 and str2) 
and determines if the first string exists within the second. 
The function should return a pointer to the beginning of the first 
(or only) occurrence of str1 within str2 or NULL otherwise.
