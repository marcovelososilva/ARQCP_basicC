##README##

Implement a program to determine how many sets of three consecutive elements exist in
an array of integer values that satisfy the condition vi < vi+1 < vi+2. Create three auxiliary
functions:
• a function to populate an array of 100 integers with random values between 0 and 20;
• a function that verifies if a set of three integers satisfies or not the given condition;
• a function to increment the number of sets.
