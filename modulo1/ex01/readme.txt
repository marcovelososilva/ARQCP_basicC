1 – Implement a program which declares the following variables:
int x = 5;
int* xPtr = &x;
float y = *xPtr + 3;
int vec[] = {10, 11, 12, 13};
The program should print:
• The value of x and y
• The address (in Hexadecimal) of x and xptr
• The value pointed by xptr
• The address of vec
• The values of vec [0], vec [1], vec [2] and vec [3]
• The addresses of vec [0], vec [1], vec [2] and vec [3]
a) Analyze the information that appears on the screen.
b) Explain the relationship between the addresses of vec, vec[0], vec[1] and vec[2].
c) If the program was run in different computers, would you expect to see the same
or different addresses of the variables?
