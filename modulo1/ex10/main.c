/* exer.10 â€“ Using pointer arithmetic,

 * The first element of the array indicates how many elements are stored on it. 
 * The function should return the sum of the even elements of the array 
 * (excluding its first element).
 * 
 * ????I DONT UNDERSTAND what means excluding the first element the 0 or the 1
 * the 0 was already excuded because was the flag should i exclude alse the number 2
 * start counting in the number 4????*/
